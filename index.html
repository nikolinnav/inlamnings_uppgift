                            Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. It is the
                            soundtrack
                            to
                            the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968.The project was
                            regarded
                            as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the
                            film.
